# Python Intro For MVPs
 
Hi folks, welcome to this repro for resources on MVPs to learn and explore Python and Notebooks.  Here you'll find a simple notebook to help you get started and additional examples.


## Setup
To get setup, we recommend you start with the [Anconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/). This will install Python, Jupyter Notebooks and a set of popular third party libaries.

After running setup, clone this repo, navigate to the folder and run the command `jupyter notebook`. You can then select one of the notebooks and try running them on your own.
