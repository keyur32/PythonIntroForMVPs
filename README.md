# PythonIntroForMVPs

Hi folks, welcome to this repro for resources on MVPs to learn about Python and Notebooks


# Setup
To get setup, we recommend you start with the [Anconda Distribution](//https://www.anaconda.com/). This will install Python, Jupyter Notebooks and a set of popular third party libaries.

After running setup, clone this repo, navigate to the folder and run the command `jupyter notebook`. You can then select one of the notebooks and try running them on your own.

# MVPs
Please send feedback directly to Keyur Patel (you should have my email :))
